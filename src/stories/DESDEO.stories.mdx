# DESDEO visualization components

These stories present the data visualization components that have been developed. The components
are intended to be used in DESDEO's front end application.

Some stories do not use Storybook's template feature to present interactive controls, because they
use a React hook to maintain component state, thus emulating how the components could be used.
As far as I know, it's not possible to use hooks with Storybook templates.
