# DESDEO data visualization components

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

## 1. Build scripts
### `npm run build`
Builds and exports the visualization components with Rollup.

### `npm run build-storybook`
Builds the application as a static Storybook application. Probably not a very useful feature.

## 2. Linting
### `npm run lint`
Runs linter and fixes linting errors.

## 3. Test scripts
### `npm test`

### `npm test:coverage`
Produces a test coverage report.

### `npm test:unit`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## 4. Running the application for local development
### `npm run storybook`
Launches Storybook for local development.
